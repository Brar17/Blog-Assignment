# The Kara: Symbol of Faith and Equality
The Kara, a steel bracelet, is one of the Five Ks of Sikhism and symbolizes an individual's connection to God and commitment to the faith. Usually worn on the right wrist, it serves as a constant reminder to act with righteousness and integrity (Shree Amritsar Sword, 2021). 
## Who made this object?
Instituted by Guru Gobind Singh Ji in 1699 during the creation of Khalsa, a collective of pure-minded Sikhs (Bains, 2020), the Kara represents Sikh beliefs and serves as a tool for guiding actions.
## Who was it made for?
Originally made for initiated Khalsa Sikhs, it is now worn by all Sikhs, regardless of initiation, symbolizing unity within the community. As Bains (2020) notes, the Kara has roots connected to the female body and the divine, representing an egalitarian code that calls everyone, regardless of gender, to live truthfully and be mindful of their actions. 
## What is the significance of its size and materials?
It is traditionally made from steel or sometimes iron, the Kara symbolizes commitment and unity. Its circular shape represents the eternal nature of God, with no beginning and no end (Shree Amritsar Sword, 2021). This design signifies the impermanence of life in the life/death cycle (Bains, 2020), while the choice of steel reflects the unbreakable bond between the individual and their faith. 
## What skill is needed to interact with this object?
While wearing the Kara doesn’t require specific skills, it carries a deeper significance in terms of spiritual mindfulness. Sikhs are reminded to engage in righteous actions, connecting their daily lives to Sikh values (Bains, 2020).
## What kind of esthetic experience is elicited by this object?
The Kara creates a sense of strength and humility through its simple design, reinforcing the idea of equality among all Sikhs and highlighting core values of discipline
## How is it involved in practice?
Worn daily, the steel bracelet serves as a continual reminder of a Sikh's purpose on this earth, encouraging them to perform righteous deeds and uphold their faith in accordance with the guidance of the Guru (Shree Amritsar Sword, 2021). During religious ceremonies, the Kara is visible, signifying the wearer’s commitment to Sikhism. 
## What is its ritual context?
Although it doesn’t play a direct role in specific rituals its presence highlights its importance in everyday life and worship. 
## Authority and Power: Gender Considerations
The Kara also challenges traditional notions of power and authority by promoting equality among all Sikhs. Worn by both men and women, it reflects the Sikh belief in gender equality. In Sikhism, both genders are seen as equal in the eyes of God, and the Kara's uniformity across all Sikhs reinforces this message. While different types of Karas exist, such as the Gold Kara and Sarabloh Kara, preferences may vary. The Sarabloh Kara, for instance, is often preferred by men for its larger size and historical use in combat (Shree Amritsar Sword, 2021).
## Conclusion
The Kara is an important material object in Sikhism, connecting Sikhs with their faith and reinforcing values of equality and righteousness. Its simple design carries an important message about the eternal nature of God and the responsibilities of living a moral life.
